# Heart Disease Prediction

## Introduction
This project was undertaken as part of the Capstone Project 1 Assignment for the Machine Learning Zoomcamp 2025. The dataset has taken from Kaggle [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nalisha/heart-disease-prediction-dataset?select=Heart_Disease_Prediction.csv)

# Problem:
Heart disease is a multi-factor condition. Detecting it early requires analyzing a wide array of clinical data (ECG, BP, Cholesterol) which can be overwhelming for traditional analysis.

# Objective:
To develop a robust classification model that predicts heart disease based on patient health markers, containerizing the solution for easy deployment in healthcare environments.

## Dataset
This dataset comprises clinical records designed for the analysis and prediction of cardiovascular conditions. By incorporating key biometric markers—including age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and ECG results—it facilitates a deeper understanding of how various health factors correlate with heart disease. It serves as a vital resource for healthcare analytics and machine learning research.

# Data Atributtes
The dataset includes 270 patient medical records with 14 columns with key health indicators. Each row represents one patient’s diagnostic information.

Target Variable: The primary goal is a binary classification task, to predict whether a patient shows heart disease: Presence or Absence.
